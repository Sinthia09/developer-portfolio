            <h3>Web developer </h3>
            <p>A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a clientâ€“server model. The
                applications typically use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the client, and any general-purpose programming
                language in the server. HTTP is used for communications between client and server. A web developer may
                specialize in client-side applications (Front-end web development), server-side applications (back-end
                development), or both (full-stack development).</p>

            <p>There is no perfect time to tell her how much she means to you. Your simple and sweet gesture already
                means a lot to her. No matter how busy she gets, reading something that comes from your heart will not
                fail to brighten up her mood. Some cute love quotes for her will help you find the right words to say.
